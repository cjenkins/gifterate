    <p>Welcome to the Wishlist Webservice by Robowarp.</p>

    <p>This webservice can be used to obtain the data in a user's Amazon Wishlist in JSON format.  Affiliate ID's are spliced into the links for Amazon items and the wishlist mechanics are preserved so the recipient address is available to ship to and the item is marked 'purchased' on the wishlist.</p>
    
    <p>To use: http://gifterate.appspot.com/wishlist/WISHLIST-ID/AFFILIATE-ID<br/>
       or: http://gifterate.appspot.com/wishlist/email/EMAIL-ADDRESS/AFFILIATE-ID
    </p>
    
    <p>Examples:<br/> 
      http://gifterate.appspot.com/wishlist/1EK29ZLJDUVDD/gifterate-20<br/>
      http://gifterate.appspot.com/wishlist/1EK29ZLJDUVDD
      http://gifterate.appspot.com/wishlist/email/johndoe@amazon.com/gifterate-20<br/>
      http://gifterate.appspot.com/wishlist/email/johndoe@amazon.com
    </p>
    
    <p>If server cannot retrieve the wishlist information for whatever reason, you will receive a JSON object of:<br/>
      {"error":"Unable to retrieve wishlist data."}</p>
    
    <p>If a valid wishlist is entered you will receive an array of JSON objects of the following format:<br/>
      [{"item":"Item Name",<br/>
      "link":"Http link to item",<br/>
      "price":"Price of item if available",<br/>
      "date-added":"Date item was added to wishlist",<br/>
      "priority":"Priority if available",<br/>
      "rating":"Amazon rating of item if available",<br/>
      "num-ratings":"Number of customer ratings if available",<br/>
      "comment":"Comment entered by wishlist creator if available"<br/>
      "picture":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UQk%2BjTRNL._SL72_.jpg"}]</p>
    
    <p>When any data is unavailable, the value returned is "n/a".</p>
    
    <p>Example:<br/>
    [{"comment":"n/a",<br/>
      "num-ratings":"221",<br/> 
      "rating":"4.5 out of 5 stars",<br/>
      "priority":"n/a",<br/>
      "date-added":"November 4, 2010",<br/>
      "price":"$29.95",<br/>
      "link":"http://www.amazon.com/Pyrex-1072164-Storage-18-Piece-Round/dp/B000HAVOC6?colid=BUWBWH9K2H77&tag=gifterate-20",<br/>
      "item":"Pyrex 1072164 Storage 18-Piece Round Set"<br/>
      "picture":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UQk%2BjTRNL._SL72_.jpg"}]</p>

    <p>If no affiliate code is entered, we will add in our own to Amazon items.<br/>
    If an affiliate code is entered, 90% of links to Amazon items will use it with the remaining 10% using our affiliate code.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, requests or problem reports, please e-mail them to jenkins DOT 333 AT gmail DOT com.
